    <h1>How Mistletoe Became a Holiday Tradition</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Ancient Origins</h2>
        <p>Mistletoe has been part of winter celebrations for thousands of years. Because it stayed green during the winter, ancient cultures viewed it as a magical and sacred plant.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Celtic Druids:</strong> Believed mistletoe brought healing and protection. They harvested it with golden sickles and used it in ceremonies.</li>
            <li><strong>Norse Mythology:</strong> A legend tells of the god Baldur, who was killed by mistletoe. His mother, Frigg, declared mistletoe a symbol of love, promising to kiss anyone beneath it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>A Symbol of Peace and Friendship</h2>
        <p>Ancient European customs required enemies who met under mistletoe to lay down their weapons. This made mistletoe a symbol of peace, unity, and goodwill—ideas closely tied to modern holiday celebrations.</p>

        <h2>Adoption Into Christmas Traditions</h2>
        <p>By the 18th century, mistletoe became a common Christmas decoration in England. One tradition allowed men to claim a kiss from anyone caught standing beneath it. A berry was removed with each kiss, and when all berries were gone, the kissing ended.</p>
